# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn risk using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and transactional data, the model classifies customers into different churn risk categories (1 to 5), enabling businesses to proactively identify and retain at-risk customers. The project is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time churn risk assessment.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, impacting revenue and growth. Early identification of customers likely to churn allows targeted retention strategies, improving customer lifetime value and reducing acquisition costs. This project leverages classification algorithms to predict churn risk scores based on customer demographics, engagement, and feedback data.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer demographics, transaction history, engagement metrics, and feedback. Key features include:
- Age, Gender, Region Category
- Membership Category, Referral Status
- Preferred Offer Types, Medium of Operation
- Login frequency, Average time spent, Transaction value
- Points in wallet, Discount usage, Complaint history
- Customer feedback and complaint status

The dataset was preprocessed by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions of churn risk scores across membership categories and feedback types.
- Analyzed relationships between churn risk and transaction value, points in wallet, and time spent.
- Identified and treated outliers using interquartile range (IQR) filtering.
- Explored feature correlations to inform model selection.

## Model Development
- Multiple classification models were evaluated: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
- Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation.
- Random Forest Classifier with 20 estimators was selected based on best performance.
- A robust pipeline was created combining preprocessing (encoding, scaling) and the trained model.

## Deployment
- The trained pipeline was saved using joblib.
- A Streamlit app was developed to provide an intuitive UI for inputting customer data and displaying churn risk predictions.
- The app categorizes churn risk into five levels with color-coded risk scores and descriptive labels.
